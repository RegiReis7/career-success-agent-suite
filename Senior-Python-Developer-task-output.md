Dear Reginaldo,

I appreciate the opportunity to assist you in your career development and job search process. Based on your education, work experience, and skills, I have compiled a comprehensive report with my recommendations.

Education:
Your Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Cape Town aligns well with the required educational background for the Senior Python Developer role. However, the job posting also mentions a preference for a Master's degree. Consider enrolling in a part-time or online Master's program to enhance your qualifications.

Work Experience:
Although you have held developer positions at FISA Strategy and Ambdextra, it is essential to provide more specific information about your Python development experience.

It is also advisable to highlight your most significant achievements and contributions in your previous roles. This will help demonstrate your expertise and value as a Senior Python Developer.

Skills:
Since Python, PostgreSQL, large language models, software architecture, RESTful APIs, microservices, cloud platforms, Git, and Docker and Kubernetes are not explicitly mentioned in your CV, it would be beneficial to do so.
